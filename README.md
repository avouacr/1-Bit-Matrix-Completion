# 1-Bit-Matrix-Completion

*Authors : Romain Avouac, Bruno Bja√Ø*

An R implementation of 1-Bit Matrix Completion. Optimization is performed using proximal gradient descent and fast truncated singular value decomposition. The algorithm is tested first on simulated data, and then on the MovieLens 100K dataset, using both train/test split and k-fold cross-validation.
